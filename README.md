## Introduction

TrinityLake is an **Open Lakehouse Format** for Big Data Analytics, ML & AI.
It allows anyone to build a fully functional lakehouse with storage (e.g. S3, HDFS) as the only dependency.

The TrinityLake format defines different objects in a lakehouse and 
provides a consistent and efficient way for accessing and manipulating the interactions among these objects.
It offers the following key features:

- **Storage only** as a lakehouse solution that works exactly the same way locally, on premise and in the cloud
- **Multi-object multi-statement transactions** with standard SQL `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` semantics
- **Consistent time travel and snapshot export** across all objects in the lakehouse
- **Distributed transactions** which can enable use cases like complicated write-audit-publish workflows
- **Compatibility with open table formats** like Apache Iceberg, supporting both standard SQL `MANAGED` and `EXTERNAL` as well as federation-based access patterns.
- **Compatibility with open catalog standards** like Apache Iceberg REST Catalog specification, serving as a highly scalable yet extremely lightweight backend implementation
